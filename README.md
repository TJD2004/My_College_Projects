Simple Calculator Application
Title: Simple Calculator Using Python

Abstract:
This project involves the development of a Simple Calculator Application using Python, demonstrating the practical application of modules, packages, file handling, and exception handling. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, while logging each operation and its result to a text file for future reference.

The application is designed with a modular structure, where each arithmetic operation is implemented in a separate module. The logging functionality writes user operations and results into a log file (calculator_log.txt) to keep a record of all interactions. Comprehensive exception handling ensures the application can gracefully handle errors such as division by zero or invalid inputs, providing user-friendly error messages.

The user interacts with the calculator via a simple console-based interface. The program is intuitive, robust, and extendable, making it suitable for educational purposes or as a template for more complex applications.

Key Features:

Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Error Handling: Graceful handling of invalid inputs and runtime errors.
File Handling: Logging of operations and results in a structured text file.
Modular Design: Code organized into separate modules and packages for scalability and maintainability.
User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-navigate console interaction.
Applications:

Demonstrates core programming concepts like modular design and exception handling.
Acts as a learning tool for beginners in Python development.
Serves as a foundation for building more advanced calculators or software solutions.
Conclusion:
The Simple Calculator Application highlights Python's ability to create practical and scalable applications with clean architecture and error-resilient design. This project is an excellent starting point for developers to explore software development best practices.
